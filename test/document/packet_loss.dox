 * \section packet_loss_1 1.0 Calculation of Bandwidth & Throughput
 * See \subpage bandwidth_and_throughput
 * \section packet_loss_2 2.0 Expectation 7
 *  All of the above should hold in the presence of any amount of dropped packets. 
 *  All flows, including the TCP flows, will see the same rate of drops. The network 
 *  will not introduce bit errors.
 * \subsection packet_loss_network Shared Test setup
 * 1. Create a cloudlab experiment using the setup for Lab2A
 * 2. ssh into Europa and Juno. In this case we will consider Juno as the sender and Europa as the receiver
 * 3. On the sender (Juno) run the following commands to clear existing settings on the network and add a new netem qdisc to limit the outbound traffic rate to 20 Mbit/s
 *    - Clear existing qdisc settings:
 *      \code{.sh}
 *      sudo tc qdisc del dev eth0 root 2>/dev/null
 *      \endcode
 *    - Add a new netem qdisc with a rate of 20 Mbit/s and packet loss of 1%:
 *      \code{.sh}
 *      sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem rate 20Mbit loss 1%
 *      \endcode
 * 
 * \subsection packet_loss_2_1 2.1 Testing a Single Instance of Our Protocol
 * \subsubsection packet_loss_2_1_1 Single Instance -  Key Requirements
 * 1. Packet dropping > 0, no reordering should be applied while testing or bit errors introduced
 * 2. No competing traffic while measuring bandwidth, use cloudlab for isolation
 * 3. Averaged over 10 seconds, with a link capacity on cloudlab of 20Mbit/s
 * 4. Requires file size of at least 20 Mb
 *
 *\subsubsection packet_loss_2_1_2 Single Instance - Usage Instructions
 * 1. On the receiver (Europa) run the following command to run the receiver, assuming the UDP port is 12345 and receiver.mp4 is an empty .mp4 file
 * \code{.sh}
 * ./receiver 12345 sample1.mp4
 * \endcode
 * 2. Now on the sender (Juno) run this command where the port number is 12345, the hostname is using the cloudlab cluster, and SampleVideo.mp4 is a 20.1 Mb file.
 * \code{.sh}
 * ./sender amdvm146-1.utah.cloudlab.us 12345 SampleVideo.mp4 60000000
 * \endcode
 * 
 *\subsubsection packet_loss_2_1_3 Single Instance - Results
 *  - Sender (Juno):
 *      \code{.sh}
 *      Sending SampleVideo.mp4 to: amdvm146-1.utah.cloudlab.us
 *       Throughput: 1.26 Mb/s
 *       Bandwidth Utilization: 6.02%
 *       Transfer duration:  163.81 s
 *       Total Bytes Sent: 25846550
 *      \endcode
 *  - Receiver (Europa):
 *      \code{.sh}
 *      Server is listening on port 12345
 *      File transfer complete. 21069678 bytes written to sample1.mp4
 *      \endcode
 *  - Discussion: Due to the lack of paralelism in our protocol our performance is hardly affected due to packet drops. 
 *      As shown the bandwidth utilization drops considerate and the transfer duration increase in more than 16x
 *
  * \subsection packet_loss_2_2 2.2 Testing a Competing Instances of Our Protocol
 * \subsubsection packet_loss_2_2_1 Competing Instances -  Key Requirements
 * 1. Packet dropping > 0, no reordering should be applied while testing or bit errors introduced
 * 2. Start two instances of our protocol at roughly the same time
 * 3. After measuring the throughput of both instances, they should be the same +/- 10%
 * 4. The convergence of throughput between the 2 inctances of the protocol should occur within 100 RTTs
 *
 *\subsubsection packet_loss_2_2_2 Competing Instances - Usage Instructions
 * 1. On receiver 1 (Europa 1) run the following command to run the receiver, assuming the UDP port is 12345 and receiver.avi is an empty .avi file
 * \code{.sh}
 * ./receiver 12345 receiver.avi
 * \endcode
 * 2. On receiver 2 (Europa 2) run the following command to run the receiver, assuming the UDP port is 12346 and receiver2.avi is an empty .avi file
 * \code{.sh}
 * ./receiver 12346 receiver2.avi
 * \endcode
 * 3. Now on both of the senders (Juno 1 & 2) prepare the commands required but don't send until you can do both at the same time
 * \code{.sh}
 * ./sender clnodevm127-1.clemson.cloudlab.us 12345 Test.avi 6000000
 * \endcode
 * \code{.sh}
 * ./sender clnodevm127-1.clemson.cloudlab.us 12346 Test2.avi 6000000
 * \endcode
 * 
 *\subsubsection packet_loss_2_2_3 Competing Instances - Results
 *    - Sender 1 (Juno 1):
 *      \code{.sh}
 *      Sending Test.avi to: amdvm146-1.utah.cloudlab.us
 *       Throughput: 0.84 Mb/s
 *       Bandwidth Utilization: 4.00%
 *       Transfer duration:  72.24 s
 *       Total Bytes Sent: 7582920
 *      \endcode
 *    - Sender 2 (Juno 2):
 *      \code{.sh}
 *       Sending Test2.avi to: amdvm146-1.utah.cloudlab.us
 *       Throughput: 0.77 Mb/s
 *       Bandwidth Utilization: 3.66%
 *       Transfer duration :  89.54 s
 *       Total Bytes Sent: 8595840
 *      \endcode
 *    - Receiver 1 (Europa 1):
 *      \code{.sh}
 *      Server is listening on port 12345
 *       File transfer complete. 5958144 bytes written to receiver.mp4
 *      \endcode
 *    - Receiver 2 (Europa 2):
 *      \code{.sh}
 *      Server is listening on port 12346
 *      File transfer complete. 5958144 bytes written to receiver2.mp4
 *      \endcode
 *    - Discussion: As expected based on the results of running the instance by itself the performance of our protocol
 *        with more than one instance running is very affectetd.
