In order to compare our implementation with the TCP protocol, we decided to create an implementation of the TCP protocol. The implementation try to be as close as possible to our enhanced protocol, but using SOCK\+\_\+\+STREAM instead. The implementation is divided in two files, \doxylink{sender__tcp_8c}{sender\+\_\+tcp.\+c} and \doxylink{receiver__tcp_8c}{receiver\+\_\+tcp.\+c}. The \doxylink{sender__tcp_8c}{sender\+\_\+tcp.\+c} file contains the implementation of functions responsible for sending data over the TCP protocol. It includes a key function tsend which handles the connection. The \doxylink{receiver__tcp_8c}{receiver\+\_\+tcp.\+c} file contains the implementation of functions responsible for receiving data over the TCP protocol. It includes key functions for handling incoming data and compiling the output file.\hypertarget{compare_tcp_file_tcp_link}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{2.\+1 Files for TCP implementation}{2.\+1 Files for TCP implementation}}\label{compare_tcp_file_tcp_link}

\item Expectation 5 -\/ Your protocol must be somewhat TCP friendly\+: an instance of TCP competing with your implementation must receive, on average, at least half as much throughput as your flow.
\item Expectation 6 -\/ An instance of your protocol competing with TCP must receive, on average, at least half as much throughput as the TCP flow. (Your protocol must not be overly nice.)

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To complete this requirement in testing we used two juno sessions for two senders and two europa sessions for two receivers. There is a pair with a TCP sender and receiver and a pair with an enhanced UDP sender and receiver.
\item We tested the two protocols competing, using the same file and the same amount of bytes to transfer, with implementations running in different ports.
\item We started the sender for the TCP and enhanced UDP protocol at almost the same time

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To complete this requirement in testing we calculated the throughput for each protocol using \doxylink{bandwidth_and_throughput}{Bandwidth \& Throughput Calculations}
\item Then we compared the throughput between the TCP implementation and our implementation to determine that the throughput of TCP was about half of the throughput of our protocol.

\item The results of this testing depend on the size of the buffer which reflects the packet size. Currently the packet size for both the sender and receiver is set at 10000.

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Create a cloudlab experiment using the setup for Lab2A
\item ssh into 2 instances of Europa and 2 instances of Juno. In this case we will consider Juno as the sender and Europa as the receiver
\item On one of the senders (Juno) run the following commands to clear existing settings on the network and add a new netem qdisc to limit the outbound traffic rate to 20 Mbit/s
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Clear existing qdisc settings\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ tc\ qdisc\ del\ dev\ eth0\ root\ 2>/dev/null}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Add a new netem qdisc with a rate of 20 Mbit/s\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ tc\ qdisc\ add\ dev\ eth0\ root\ netem\ rate\ 20Mbit}

\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item On the TCP receiver (Europa 1) run the following command to run the TCP implementation of the receiver, assuming the UDP port is 12345 and receiver.\+avi is an empty .avi file 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./receiver\_tcp\ 12345\ receiver.avi}

\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item On the enhanced UDP receiver (Europa 2) run the following command to run the enhanced UDP implementation of the receiver, assuming the UDP port is 12346 and receiver2.\+avi is an empty .avi file 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./receiver\ 12346\ receiver2.avi}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Now on both of the senders (Juno 1 \& 2) prepare the commands required but don\textquotesingle{}t send until you can do both at the same time

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The calculation for the throughput and bandwidth was giving us a value of \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}100\%, however we believe this is likely due to the fact that the limiting commands we use to set up our network, sometimes still allows a transfer of data at a rate higher than the one set by the command.
\item Based on the fact that our enhanced protocol is taking on 71.\+82\% and with the above considered we believe that our protocol receives somewhat similar throughput.
