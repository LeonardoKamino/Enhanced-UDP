In order to compare our implementation with the TCP protocol, we decided to create an implementation of the TCP protocol. The implementation try to be as close as possible to our enhanced protocol, but using SOCK\+\_\+\+STREAM instead. The implementation is divided in two files, \doxylink{sender__tcp_8c}{sender\+\_\+tcp.\+c} and \doxylink{receiver__tcp_8c}{receiver\+\_\+tcp.\+c}. The \doxylink{sender__tcp_8c}{sender\+\_\+tcp.\+c} file contains the implementation of functions responsible for sending data over the TCP protocol. It includes a key function tsend which handles the connection. The \doxylink{receiver__tcp_8c}{receiver\+\_\+tcp.\+c} file contains the implementation of functions responsible for receiving data over the TCP protocol. It includes key functions for handling incoming data and compiling the output file. \hypertarget{compare_tcp_file_tcp_link}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{2.\+1 Files for TCP implementation}{2.\+1 Files for TCP implementation}}\label{compare_tcp_file_tcp_link}

We decided to compare the two protocols by sending a file over a TCP connection and over our enhanced UDP protocol. We used the same file and the same amount of bytes to transfer. We also used the same machine and the same network conditions. \hypertarget{compare_tcp_test_tcp_ind}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Testing Protocols Independently}{Testing Protocols Independently}}\label{compare_tcp_test_tcp_ind}
We tested the two protocols independently, using the same file and the same amount of bytes to transfer and the same port on the same machine.\hypertarget{compare_tcp_test_tcp_comp}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Testing Protocols Competing}{Testing Protocols Competing}}\label{compare_tcp_test_tcp_comp}
We tested the two protocols competing, using the same file and the same amount of bytes to transfer, with implementation running in different ports. We started the receiver of the two protocols and then we started the sender of the two protocols, with a brief time period between starting each protocol. \input{bandwidth_and_throughput}
